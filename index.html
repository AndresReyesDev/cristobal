        <h2>Equilibrium in marine biology</h2>
        <img src="equilibrium-1.png" alt="Equilibrium 1" />
        <strong
          >Chemical equilibrium plays a crucial role in the balance of marine
          ecosystems. For marine biologists, understanding how shifts in
          equilibrium affect ocean chemistry is essential, particularly in the
          context of ocean acidification. This phenomenon, driven by increasing
          atmospheric carbon dioxide (COz), disrupts the natural equilibrium of
          carbonate chemistry in seawater, with significant consequences for
          calcifying organisms. When COz is absorbed by seawater, it
          participates in a series of reversible chemical reactions creating a
          dynamic equilibrium</strong
        >
        <hr class="margen" />

        <h3>Calcification Process</h3>
        
        <p>
          Calcifying organisms combine calcium ions (Ca²⁺) and carbonate ions
          (CO₃²⁻) to form calcium carbonate (CaCO₃):
        </p>
        <p>Ca²⁺ + CO₃²⁻ → CaCO₃</p>

        <p>
          As ocean acidity increases, the equilibrium in the carbonate system
          shifts to the side that produces more bicarbonate ions (HCO₃⁻) and
          free hydrogen ions (H⁺), reducing the availability of carbonate ions
          (CO₃²⁻). This shift occurs due to Le Chatelier's Principle, which
          states that a system at equilibrium will adjust to counteract changes
          in conditions.
        </p>

        <p>
          When atmospheric CO₂ dissolves into seawater, it forms dissolved
          carbon dioxide (CO₂(aq)), which reacts with water to produce carbonic
          acid (H₂CO₃). This carbonic acid dissociates into bicarbonate ions
          (HCO₃⁻) and hydrogen ions (H⁺). The presence of excess hydrogen ions
          shifts the equilibrium further, encouraging the formation of more
          bicarbonate at the expense of carbonate ions. This process diminishes
          the availability of carbonate ions (CO₃²⁻), which are essential for
          calcifying organisms to build calcium carbonate (CaCO₃) shells and
          skeletons. As a result, the equilibrium adjustments driven by
          increased acidity directly impact the capacity of marine organisms to
          maintain their structural integrity, leading to significant ecological
          consequences.
        </p>


        <p>
          The reduction in available carbonate ions directly impacts
          calcification, making it increasingly difficult for organisms such as
          corals, mollusks, and pteropods to build and maintain calcium
          carbonate structures. This can have broader impacts in food webs as
          animals like pteropods are the main source of food for whales and
          other filter feeders.
        </p>

        <p>
          The reduced calcification also affects reef-building, which is vital
          for biodiversity and coastal protection, as coral reefs serve as
          nurseries for many marine species. Furthermore, ocean acidification
          impairs the sensory functions of larval fish, such as their ability to
          detect predators, significantly reducing their survival rates.
        </p>

        <p>
          Marine biologists monitor these chemical shifts and study the
          resilience of marine species. Mitigating acidification requires global
          efforts to reduce CO₂ emissions and explore localized solutions, such
          as growing seaweed to absorb CO₂. Understanding the chemical
          equilibrium that governs ocean acidity is critical to preserving
          marine ecosystems and the services they provide to humanity.
